# Credit_Card_Defaulters_Analysis_Project
This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the "Default of Credit Card Clients" dataset. The dataset contains information on credit card holders in Taiwan, focusing on whether they defaulted on their payments. Credit card default is a major concern for banks and financial institutions, as it can lead to significant financial losses.
